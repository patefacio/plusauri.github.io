There are several benefits:\n\n\nIt is a decent data modeling system. It supports the important primitive types\n(in32, double, ...), data composition with Messages, enumerations with\nEnum, and union types with OneOf.\n\n\nGoogle support, along with other providers, means we can get generated\nsupporting data structures for all the major languages including ours: rust,\nkotlin, typescript.\n\n\nFor rust we use tonic, which\nunder the covers uses prost\n\n\nFor kotlin we use google's protoc compiler which generates the java\nclasses and then generates a kotlin layer on top which adds a very\nconvenient Domain Specific Language (DSL).\n\n\n\n\nPotentially, in the future we may even use it for its original intent -\nserialization and possibly rpc.\n\n\nRather than write proto3 IDL (Interface Definition Language)  directly we\ncreate the models in kotlin and then generate the proto3 files. This allows us\nto have programmatic access to all the modeled items. Had we written directly in\nproto3 IDL, to access the modeled schema from kotlin we would then have to\ngenerate the kotlin support using the proto compiler, which we do, and then go\nthrough the generated kotlin files for all access. We do use the generated\nkotlin libraries for the convenient DSL, but it takes some getting used to and\nis not convenient as our simple wrapper library over the structures of proto3.\nIn summary, we use kotlin to model the proto3 language, which we use to\nmodel our financial structures. proto3 deals in these primary concepts:\n\n\nProtoBuff File This is a file containing proto3 idl. That is it is a file\ncontaining various declarations of the following items.\n\n\nMessage This is conceptually like a struct in rust or data class in\nkotlin.\n\n\n_ Enum This is conceptually like an enum with named Unit Structs in rust,\nor the simple enum class of kotlin.\n\nOneOf This is conceptually like a more complex enum in rust that acts to\ndiscriminate on different types with their own corresponding data.\n\nHere is the kotlin constructor for Message:\n/** A modeled message.\n *\n * @property nameId The name of the message.\n * @property doc The documentation for the message.\n * @property fields List of fields in the message.\n * @property messages List of (sub)messages in the message.\n * @property enums List of enums in the message.\n */\ndata class Message(\n    val nameId: String,\n    val doc: String = missingDoc(nameId, \"Proto Message\"),\n    val fields: List&lt;MessageField&gt; = emptyList(),\n    val messages: List&lt;Message&gt; = emptyList(),\n    val enums: List&lt;Enum&gt; = emptyList()\n) {\n    ...\n}\n\nExample Message\nIn our system it is important to know two assumptions related to age when running a forecast:\n\n\nretirement age: The age the user plans to retire. This impacts the forecast\nbecause the income associated with a job will likely cease.\n\n\ndeath age: How long the user expects to live. This scopes how far out a\nforecast should go.\n\n\nIn the proto3 IDL this might be defined in a file called age_assumptions.proto as simply:\n/*\n  Assumptions regarding the ages of a person _at retirement_, _at death_, etc.\n*/\nmessage AgeAssumptions {\n  /*\n    Age of retirement, generally when labor incomes are ended.\n  */\n  uint32 retirement_age = 1;\n  \n  /*\n    Age at death.\n  */\n  uint32 death_age = 2;\n}\n\nWhen this proto3 IDL is passed through the tonic code generator it will generate the following rust:\n/// Assumptions regarding the ages of a person _at retirement_, _at death_, etc.\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Copy, Hash, Ord, PartialOrd, Eq)]\n#[derive(Clone, PartialEq, ::prost::Message)]\npub struct AgeAssumptions {\n    ///\n    /// Age of retirement, generally when labor incomes are ended.\n    #[prost(uint32, tag=\"1\")]\n    pub retirement_age: u32,\n    ///\n    /// Age at death.\n    #[prost(uint32, tag=\"2\")]\n    pub death_age: u32,\n}\n\nThat is a simple, beautiful mapping to rust of our modeled AgeAssumptions message.\nWhen this proto3 IDL is passed through the protoc compiler targeting\nkotlin it generates a java class to support this structure. That java class\nis humongous and will not be shown here as code. Here is an image of the\nstructure in the IDE.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are good reasons for the code being generated like this. For example, it\nlooks like all access to our retirement_age and death_age fields are to be\naccessed via the access methods {getRetirementAge, getDeathAge}. \nBut we don't intend to use java support, except to the extent the kotlin DSL\nuses it, which fortunately we are shielded from. The generated kotlin provides\nan also large collection of code, but structurally it is much simpler:\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can tell it is much simpler to use this than the java, although the DSL\ntakes some getting used to.\nAs previously stated, we don't write the proto3 IDL directly. Rather we create\nthe models in kotlin and generate the proto files which are then used to\ngenerate the rust code. The AgeAssumption is modeled as follows in kotlin:\nMessage(\n    \"age_assumptions\",\n    \"Assumptions regarding the ages of a person _at retirement_, _at death_, etc.\",\n    Field(\"retirement_age\", FieldType.ProtoUInt32,\n        \"Age of retirement, generally when labor incomes are ended.\"),\n    Field(\"death_age\", FieldType.ProtoUInt32, \"Age at death.\")\n)\n\nSince we don't actually write the proto files directly, we model the\nfile also and the code generation process creates the proto file:\nval ageAssumptionsProto = ProtoFile(\n    \"age_assumptions\",\n    \"Module for defining age assumptions.\",\n    messages = listOf(\n        Message(\n            \"age_assumptions\",\n            \"Assumptions regarding the ages of a person _at retirement_, _at death_, etc.\",\n            Field(\"retirement_age\", FieldType.ProtoUInt32,\n                \"Age of retirement, generally when labor incomes are ended.\"),\n            Field(\"death_age\", FieldType.ProtoUInt32, \"Age at death.\")\n        )\n    )\n)\n\nWhat To Model\nMy initial impulse was to model as much as possible with the idea that the\nbenefit is all things modeled will be accessible to client side via typescript\ngeneration. But proto3 modeled messages transform into rust fields that are\noptional (See also Proto Optional)\nwhich fair bit of None checking. But there are other potential pain points when modeling in \nModel SourceRustProto3Winner\nAdding functionalityLess friction (1) on adding functionality.Not available to marshal from server to client.Rust/8\nClient InteropNo ability to send to client typescript.Can marshal to typescript or other language services.Proto/8\nNone/Null CheckingYou can drop Option&lt;...&gt;You'll be adding if let Some(field) = field oftenRust/3\nModeling PowerFull power of rust language availableLimited to proto3 simplicity of messages, enums one_ofsRust/2\n\n\nfriction The generated rust crate that all modeled messages go into\nshould have little to no functionality. It should really be only the data\nstructures. But at some point you need to associate functions with the data.\nThis is business logic and should be put with the rest of the business logic\n(i.e. in the client crate).\n\nInitially we are targeting minimal work client side. Less work client side means\nless javascript/typescript coding which alone has benefits. We will need views\nfor all sorts of outputs for the forecast and those could be done by passing\njson results to the client and having the typescript create the views. Or we\ncould create the view on the server and pass html to the client. Of course,\nwhen the user creates the dossier that will have to be client side and have a\nfair bit of typescript.\nThe obvious case where proto3 modeling is a given:\n\nThe data is something that must be sent from the client to the server. This\nincludes all items in the dossier (e.g. balance_sheet, account,\nholding, worth...) since the user must create this on the client. Because\nwe use proto3 to generate the code support in typescript this should be\nmodeled so client side has code that matches our models.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe real question is with data returned from the server to the client which are\nsome representation of the generated forecasts (including tables, distributions,\ncharts,...), statistics, maybe some suggestions. That data could be json or\nhtml. Making it json gives the client code the ability to do things with it.\nThat is not currently important, but it may be in the future. Making it html\nsuggests the client will simply show the data somewhere.\nThen there is all the modeled data that represent pieces of the forecast\ncalculations. Those are created and managed on the server, but in the future we\nmay want lots of it to be available to the client. If we model in rust that\nmakes it quite a bit simpler for the developer.\nExample TaxInputs and TaxableIncomes\nWhen creating a forecast for a dossier the forecast engine goes through each\nyear and mimics what a user would do financially. Depending on configuration the\nengine will track various types of taxable incomes in order to calculate taxes.\n/// Break down of income for tax purposes.\npub struct TaxableIncomes {\n    ///\n    /// Income from salary, wages, earnings from self-employment, etc.\n    pub earned_income: f64,\n    ///\n    /// Income from interest, non-qualified dividends and capital gain distributions, taxed at ordinary income.\n    pub portfolio_income: f64,\n    ///\n    /// Income from qualified dividends, taxed at scaled rate (0, 15, 20) based on taxable income.\n    pub qualified_dividends: f64,\n    ///\n    /// Gains/losses from sales of securities held one year or more.\n    pub long_term_capital_gains: f64,\n    ///\n    /// Rental income, income from business that does not require involvement, royalties on IP, etc.\n    pub passive_income: f64,\n    ///\n    /// Income bucketed with the rest, not subject to SS and Medicare and not covered by any others.\n    pub ordinary_income: f64,\n}\n\nInitially that only exists on the server since the server is the entity creating\nthe forecast - generating returns and incomes, losses. This is like a utility\nclass the server uses to track details. This is one piece of multiple that are\nrequired to calculate taxes. In addition to the taxable incomes the forecaster\nneeds to track expenses that may be deductible.\n/// Tax related inputs to the tax calculators.\npub struct TaxInputs {\n    ///\n    /// Breakdown of incomes by type.\n    pub incomes: ::core::option::Option&lt;TaxableIncomes&gt;,\n    ///\n    /// Mapping of expenses (i.e. `SystemId::FlowItemId`) that may be deductible.\n    /// Whether they are deductible or not usually depends on an intricate web of rules.\n    /// This map can be used by the calculator to focus on money paid that may be deductible.\n    /// The calculator will have details on whether and to what extent the amounts may be\n    /// deducted.\n    pub maybe_deductible_expenses: ::std::collections::HashMap&lt;u32, f64&gt;,\n}\n\nInitially both these were modeled in proto3 because I wanted to ensure\nanything could be sent to the client if needed. But now I'm thinking that may be\noverkill and these are better modeled directly in rust. The kicker here is the\nHashMap&lt;u32, f64&gt; type on maybe_deductible_expenses. I've already modeled a\nheavily used proto3 message type called SystemId that is used to identify a\nsystem categories. I want to use that as a key so all expense categories can be\nmapped to their value. Unfortunately proto3 only supports strings and integers\nas keys to maps so that can't be modeled well. To get around this I have to deal\nin the numeric value associated with the SystemId and do lots of rust matching\nwhen dealing with this field. This is an example of a small weakness in\nproto3. Would be great if they could model a mapping from one message to any\nother type.\nNote the incomes field\nis wrapped in an Option&lt;...&gt; meaning it must be None checked whenever used.\nThe relevant questions:\n\n\nIs this ever sent from the client to the server? No. The server receives\nrequests to create forecasts and in the process creates these intermediate\nvalues. \n\n\nWould our client benefit from the server being sending that data as\njson, as opposed to html. At a minimum we want to be able to show finely\ntuned details into the calculations to gain confidence and illustrate how the\nengine works. But the simple way to convey this data is for the server to\nhave a template that shows this data as a nice html table that can be sent to\nthe client. The case for prot3 is maybe we'll want to push some of the\nstructure to html into the client in the future, so client side code can\ncreate its own views using some of the nice client side tools.\n\n\nHow expensive is it to add as proto3 in the future if we go with rust\nnow? In general, not too bad because we could just duplicate structs modeled\nin rust out to proto3. We could decide in the future to replace our rust\nwith the proto3 or just leave the rust usage and field copy the data for\nresponses in json.\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/developer_docs/code-generation/","title":"Code Generation"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/developer_docs/proto-optional/":{"body":"\nproto3 no longer has required fields. Apparently those caused lots of issues\nover time in large organizations, like Google the creator. Optional is still a\nvalid keyword but its interpretation can be a bit confusing in general and\nespecially in the context of rust code generation. In proto3 there is no\nlonger a concept of a required fields, so all fields of message type are\noptional in the sense they don't need to be passed as part of the serialization\nprocess. In rust fields of message type are always wrapped in Option&lt;...&gt;.\nExample Message with fields that are Message type\n/*\n  An index into a 2D matrix of correlations\n*/\nmessage DossierCorrelationEntry {\n  /*\n    Row index of correlation\n  */\n  DossierGrowthItemIndex row_index = 1;\n  \n  /*\n    Column index of correlation\n  */\n  DossierGrowthItemIndex column_index = 2;\n  \n  /*\n    Correlation for pair of dossier items\n  */\n  double correlation = 3;\n}\n\nIn this example the row_index and column_index are typed as\nDossierGrowthItemIndex which is a Message type. The corresponding rust is:\n///\n/// An index into a 2D matrix of correlations\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]\n#[derive(Clone, PartialEq, ::prost::Message)]\npub struct DossierCorrelationEntry {\n    ///\n    /// Row index of correlation\n    #[prost(message, optional, tag=\"1\")]\n    pub row_index: ::core::option::Option&lt;DossierGrowthItemIndex&gt;,\n    ///\n    /// Column index of correlation\n    #[prost(message, optional, tag=\"2\")]\n    pub column_index: ::core::option::Option&lt;DossierGrowthItemIndex&gt;,\n    ///\n    /// Correlation for pair of dossier items\n    #[prost(double, tag=\"3\")]\n    pub correlation: f64,\n}\n\nNotice that both fields are types wrapped in Option&lt;...&gt;. This is because by\ndesign in the proto3 system all non-primitive fields are optional. This can be a\ndrag on the coding side because now every access to row_index and\ncolumn_index need to deal with possibility of value being None. That alone\nis painful but workable. The really tough part is when the fields really need to\nbe present for the struct to be considered valid. A DossierCorrelationEntry\nwith an None for either row_index or column_index is useless. So\nregardless of what the proto3 spec says we want our own mechanism of\ndetermining which fields are truly required. In this case we would like both\nfields to be required.\nIt happens that, even though all fields in proto3 are optional, there still is\nneed for and use of an optional keyword in the messages. A field labeled\noptional is obviously optional since it already was. In addition that field\nmay have extra generated methods that allow the code to determine if the\noptional value was present on the wire.\nEnums and primitive numbers are not optional in the sense that they are\nalways sent. When values are not specified for enums the default value is\nalways one of the variants (e.g. the first enumerant). For numbers it is 0.\nFor example, in this message both fields are primitives.\nmessage AgeAssumptions {\n  /*\n    Age of retirement, generally when labor incomes are ended.\n  */\n  uint32 retirement_age = 1;\n  \n  /*\n    Age at death.\n  */\n  uint32 death_age = 2;\n}\n\nThe resulting rust is:\npub struct AgeAssumptions {\n    ///\n    /// Age of retirement, generally when labor incomes are ended.\n    #[prost(uint32, tag=\"1\")]\n    pub retirement_age: u32,\n    ///\n    /// Age at death.\n    #[prost(uint32, tag=\"2\")]\n    pub death_age: u32,\n}\n\nNote the primitive is not wrapped in Option&lt;u32&gt;. I guess the general idea\nwas you can use the default of 0 to assume the value was not sent. But that\nfalls apart if 0 is a valid number that can be sent. If you have a 0 you don't\nknow if it was specifically set to 0 by the client or just not set at all.\nBecause of this issue the optional keyword has been made available. So if you\nwanted to deal with immortality you could specify:\nmessage AgeAssumptions {\n  /*\n    Age of retirement, generally when labor incomes are ended.\n  */\n  uint32 retirement_age = 1;\n  \n  /*\n    Age at death.\n  */\n  optional uint32 death_age = 2;\n}\n\nIn this case a value of 0 for death_age in a deserialized message gives the\nclient code an opportunity to check if it was present as 0 or just 0 because\nthat is the default. In rust it is transformed into type Option&lt;u32&gt; which\ngive you that capability. We use this feature in certain cases.\nThe optional keyword can be used for fields of message type as well, but\nseems to have no effect.\nInferring Required Fields\nWe use proto3 for multiple potential purposes:\n\n\nFor serialization/transmission: This may or may not happen because the\nprotocol has standardized approach to json serialization and postgres has\njson type support, so it is not clear if we will go all in with proto3.\n\n\nFor modeling: It is not perfect but it is a pretty good modeling language.\nFocusing on the models first can make for a better system.\n\n\nFor multi-language support: Both backend and frontend code generation in all\nthe big languages is a huge win.\n\n\nSo, in our setup all message fields are required unless they've been tagged\noptional. This is not saying the code generation will honor that - it won't.\nBut we can understand that from our perspective - if a field is modeled as a\nmessage it is required unless tagged optional. To that end we generate\nvalidation support based on the RequiredFieldsPresent trait.\npub trait RequiredFieldsPresent {\n    /// Requires presence of all fields of type Message that are not specifically `optional`.\n    ///\n    ///   * _return_ - True if all fields present (recursively).\n    fn required_fields_present(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;(), ForecastError&gt;;\n}\n\nOur code generation then augments the prost rust code generation to implement\nthis trait for each message type. For the following message the implementation\nbelow is generated:\n/*\n  Attributes that specify a bond.\n*/\nmessage BondSpec {\n  /*\n    The face value of the bond.\n  */\n  double face_value = 1;\n  \n  /*\n    Annual bond payment. \n    Quoted as either dollar value or percent of `face_value` based on\n    `is_percent_of_face`.\n  */\n  core.RateCurve annual_coupon = 2;\n  \n  /*\n    Maturity date.\n  */\n  core.Date maturity = 3;\n  \n  /*\n    If true the values of `annual_coupon` represent percentage of face.\n  */\n  bool is_percent_of_face = 4;\n}\n\nGenerated Rust\nimpl RequiredFieldsPresent for BondSpec {\n    /// Checks all fields of type Message that are not specifically `optional` to ensure they are present.\n    ///\n    ///   * _return_ - True if all fields present (recursively).\n    fn required_fields_present(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;(), ForecastError&gt; {\n        if self.annual_coupon.is_none() {\n            return Err(ForecastError::MissingRequiredField {\n                type_name: \"account::BondSpec\",\n                field_name: \"annual_coupon\",\n            });\n        }\n        if self.maturity.is_none() {\n            return Err(ForecastError::MissingRequiredField {\n                type_name: \"account::BondSpec\",\n                field_name: \"maturity\",\n            });\n        }\n        Ok(())\n    }\n}\n\nIn this case it is requiring an annual_coupon and maturity be provided for\nthe instance to be considered valid. It ignores primitives and enums since they\nare present.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/developer_docs/proto-optional/","title":"Proto Optional"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/education/":{"body":"\nConsistere silvaque facta\nTimemus genitor et inportuna annua Amphrysi non\nLorem markdownum Bromumque aethera canam terga crimen tamen\ntemplo tellure et docuique Lucifero virgo magnae\nindagine murmure!

That something is called the investment returns and they come in a\nvariety forms:\n\nstock dividends\nbond interest payments\ncapital gain distributions\ncapital gains\n\nStocks Versus Bonds\nStock Capital Gains\nWhen you invest in stocks you are taking ownership in a company. Granted, it\nis typically a very small portion, for example your 100 shares out of maybe\nbillions. If the company does well your ownership value increases and conversely\nif it does poorly your ownership value decreases. One nice feature of your\nownership is that the losses are capped at the total amount you invested. It is\nconvenient to think of these potential investment returns in percentage terms.\nIf the stock goes up 10% after you purchased the value of your investment has\ngone up 10% as well. In this case you have an unrealized gain of 10%. When a\nstock does well you can can decide to take your gains by selling the stock in\nthe market for more than you purchased it and that difference is a form of\ninvestment return called capital gains. Capital gains get their own\ntreatment when it comes to taxes. One of the fun, and scary, aspects of stocks\nis you don't get to know up front what that return will be.\nBonds Pay Interest\nWhen you invest in bonds you are typically signing up to get all your money\nback, plus some additional returns. That time in the future when you get your\nprincipal (i.e. original investment) plus the returns is called the bond\nmaturity. Some bonds, called coupon bonds provide returns in the form of\ninterest or coupon payments on some scheduled basis (e.g. semi-annually or\nannualy) and eventually returns the original investment at bond maturity. In\neither form or combination of them, you know up front to what you can expect in\nreturn. \nOne primary difference between stocks and bonds is that for bonds you know what\nyour returns will be and for stocks you don't. For this reason bonds are often\nreferred to as a fixed income product.\nEven for bonds there is some risk that the return you expect may not be paid. If\nthe bond is company or government issued that company or government may go bust\nand your returns are at risk. Typically these risks are lower than risks\nassociated with stocks and there is an industry of experts (e.g. bond ratings\nagencies like MorningStar) that rate bonds for their quality (i.e. ability to\npay on their obligations).\n\nIn general stocks are riskier than bonds\n\nStocks Pay Dividends\nSome stocks give some of their investment returns back to the investor in the\nform of stock dividends. These are payments typically made on a schedule (e.g.\nquarterly, semi-annually) and are not guaranteed. From the perspective of an\ninvestor, stock dividends look very similar to bond interest payments. They\ndiffer in that the amount of dividends is not agreed to up front and for tax\npurposes they are classified differently. For tax purposes some stock dividends\nqualify for special tax rates. For bonds and stocks you will typically get these\ntypes of returns in the form of cash payments:\n\nQualified Stock Dividends\nUnqualified Stock Dividends\nBond Interest Payments\n\nBecause these are treated differently, understanding the makeup of such returns\ncan help when planning.\nYou Decide When To Sell\nWhether you have a bond or stock you can always decide to sell. At that point\nyou will have a capital gain or capital loss depending on the sale value\ncompared to your purchase value. The purchase value, i.e. the amount you paid\nfor the investment, is called the cost basis. The dividends and interest\npayments you have received along the way get taxed annually as they come to you.\nBut the capital gain or capital loss timing is entirely up to you and\nchoices made here can have large impacts on finances and planning.\nMutual Funds\nMutual funds are collections of investments managed by a portfolio manager.\nThese investment vehicles buy in and sell out of securities to reach some stated\nset of goals. When the fund makes these sales they track the gains/losses and as\nan investor in the fund you will get capital gain distributions based on the\nfunds investment obligations. You don't choose when the individual stocks are\npurchased or sold from the fund, the investment manager does. You simply receive\nsome capital gain distributions from the fund and you pay appropriate taxes on\nthem.\nMoney Flows\nAs you accumulate stocks, bonds, and mutual funds you may expect to receive:\n\nbond interest payments\nstock dividends (qualified and unqualified)\ncapital gain distributions\n\nYou receive these payments by virtue of ownership of the investment;\nthere is no decision making involved other than the original decision to invest.\nThe other net inflows (or outflows) are from the sales of investments - which\nyou decide the timing of. Whether selling a bond, stock, or mutual fund, these\ngains are called capital gains (don't confuse this with capital gain\ndistrubutions). It is important to remember when talking about stock returns,\nignoring dividends, they never come to you without the sale.\nFor planning purposes these are modeled in terms of percentages of the original\ninvestment. Stock dividends are usually more variable because the basis of the\ndividend is often the value of the company (i.e. its market capitlization)\nwhich itself can vary quite a bit. Also they vary more because management\ndecides what to pay out in dividends and they have the right to change it. The\npoint is, when planning it helps to know that the cash payments from bonds are\nmore reliable than those of stock dividends and mutual fund capital gain\ndistributions.\nReinvestment\nYou invest in a stock and they may turn around and give you some of it back each\nyear in the form of dividends. You might not like that - after all you have to\npay taxes on those dividends. But those taxes are typically cheaper than other\ntaxes on investment returns. However, because you may not want those dividends\naccumulating in cash balances and remaining uninvested over time, most\ninvestment companies provide an option to reinvest dividends. You don't get\nout of paying taxes on those dividends, but at least that money gets funneled\nback into the investment you originally chose. \nScale And Examples\nBond interest payments are heavily influenced by interest rates and what the\nmarket expects. Both governments and companies issue bonds. The latter are known\nas corporate bonds and usually pay a higher interest payment because they are\nriskier than the government. It can be a bit tricky trying to compare returns of\ninvestments because some have multiple types of returns. Stocks have dividends\nbut the bulk of returns are at sale. Bonds have interest payments and there may\nbe a premium/discount associated with the investment. In general, thinking of\nstock or bond returns in the form of their total return makes comparison\neasier. When you see comparisons of bonds, stocks and other instruments with a\nsingle percentage return number it is most likely a total return percentage.\nFor stocks, from that total return dividends may have be paid out. To even\ncalculate the total return some methodology must have been adopted in\nassessing the impact of dividends. You could calculate total return assuming all\ndividends are reinvested or you could calculate them assuming they all get\npooled into a cash bucket which also gets some, likely very small return\nassigned.\nForbes - Stock And Bond Returns\nStocks/Bonds/Mix\n\n\n\nDepending on your source stocks are typically said to be returning somewhere\nbetween 9% and up to 12% and bonds are historically averaging around 5%. It is\nimportant to remember these numbers are averages and the annual returns going\ninto these can vary quite a bit.\nHere is another breakdown from Vanguard Portfolio\nAllocations\nwhere they look at returns from the perspective of those looking for income\n(e.g. those who want dividends and interest payments to live on) versus those\nwanting more returns from growth (e.g. whenver they decide to sell).\nIncome Focused Returns\nVanguard - Historic Income Portfolio Returns\n\n\n\nThis graphic is showing that a portfolio of entirely fixed income products (bonds) has averaged total returns of 5.33%. The graphic also shows the effect of mixing in equity with the fixed income portfolio in varying degrees and the impact on average annual returns.\nGrowth Focused Returns\nVanguard - Historic Growth Portfolio Returns\n\n\n\nThis graphic is showing that a portfolio of all stocks (100% equity) has averaged 10.29% total returns. This is similar to the Forbes number of 9.59%.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/education/investment-returns/","title":"Investment Returns"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/education/return-variance/":{"body":"\n\nSection Summary (Reading Level=Intermediate) \n\nRisk versus return\nReturn standard deviation as the measure of risk\nCombining risky assets/Correlation\nDiversification\n\n\nIn the previous section we made the assertion that stocks are generally riskier\nthan bonds. Here we see how that statement can be quantified.\nMuch of this content relies heavily on basic statistics.\nReturns Are Stochastic\nStochastic is a fancy word meaning there is variability associated with the\nnumber. A dictionary definition of stochastic:\n\nrandomly determined; having a random probability distribution or pattern that\nmay be analyzed statistically but may not be predicted precisely.\n\nIf I invest one dollar in some investment security I, what will be my return?\nThe answer to that question is - we don't know but if history is a guide and if\nwe have some history then we can attempt characterize that return.\nIt is important to keep in mind that we are talking about variability of the\nreturn. Variability of the return implies the total value of your investment\nwill ultimately vary. But the variance in the final investment value is driven\nby the variance in the returns. The total value of an investment depends on the\nreturns in the following way:\n$$I_f = I_{i} * (1 + r)$$\nReturns As Normally Distributed Variables\nIf your initial investment is $100 and if you have a return of 5% (i.e. r\n= 0.05), then the final value of your investment in a single period is (100 *\n1.05) or $105. While this is the value of your final investment if r is 5%,\nwe don't know with certainty what r is going to be. We may have an hunch, an\nidea, a promise; but things happen. Throughout finance returns such as this are\noften modeled as a normally distributed variable and then we can use\nstatistics to reason better about potential outcomes.\nRecall from basic statistics that normally distributed variables are\ncharacterized by their mean and standard deviation. \nThe mean, also called average, of a series of random draws is simply the sum\nof the values divided by the number of elements. \nThe standard deviation is a measure of dispersion of the data in relation to\nits mean. The formula for standard deviation is:\n$$s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\overline{x})^2}$$\nThat x with the bar over it is defined as the mean. If the mean of a set of\nnumbers is simply adding them up and dividing by the number of them, then the\nstandard deviation is adding up all deviations from the mean and dividing by\nthe number of them. So, intuitively, it is a way of averaging how far the\nnumbers deviate from the mean. The squaring of the difference (and subsequent\nsquare root) is there just to treat deviations above the mean and deviations\nbelow the mean similarly.\n\nStandard deviation is a single number in the same units of the random\nvariable which you can used to understand how variable it is. Bigger standard\ndeviation means bigger variance. In terms of returns bigger standard\ndeviation  means more chance of losing your shirt and hitting the\njackpot.\n\nIf you have taken statistics you have seen this familiar image:\nNormal Distribution (a.k.a. Bell Curve)\n\n\nThis is a probability distribution chart and it uses our ability to\nintuitively understand areas to quickly convey probabilities of where\nstochastic (i.e. random) variables are likely to fall. \nIn this picture the mean is labeled μ and the standard deviation is labeled σ.\nIf you know both the mean and the standard deviation of a normally distributed\nvariable you know a good deal about it. You still cannot predict the future -\nbut you know more about the possibilities and probabilities.\nFirst assume the total area under this curve is 1, or 100% if you prefer to\nthink in percents. Then pick any two x values and the area under the curve\nbetween those two x values as a percentage of the total area of the curve\nrepresents the percent probability that a random draw is between those two x\nvalues.\nThats a lot of words but there are three examples demonstrating that way of\nthinking displayed in this chart. Lets walk through two of the three cases\ndescribing what the chart says assuming that we have a random variable of μ=8%\nand a standard deviation of σ=15%.\n\nThe Pink Area\n\nPick the first x as (μ-σ) (8% - 15% = -7%) and the second as (μ+σ)\n(8% + 15% = 23%).\nEstimate the area under the curve between those two points (x=-7% and\nx=23%). In this case you don't need to guess because the chart has shown\nthe percentage for you. This is the pink area which represents about 68% of\nthe entire area and that pink area effectively includes all possibilities\nwithin one standard deviation (i.e. σ=15%) of the mean (i.e. μ=8%)\nState the conclusion:\n\nThere is a 68% chance that your return will be between (-7% and 23%)\n\n\n\n\nThe Pink AND Blue Area combined\n\nPick the first x as (μ-2σ) (8% - 30% = -22%) and the second as (μ+2σ)\n(8% + 30% = 38%).\nEstimate the area under the curve between those two points (x=-22% and\nx=38%). Again the chart is showing the combined pink and blue\nareas represent 95.45% of the distribution. \nState the conclusion:\n\nThere is a 95% chance that your return will be between (-22% and 38%)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this picture the pink area shown is 68.27% of the area and therefore there is\na roughly 68% chance that a random draw from any normally distributed variable\nwill be in the range:\n$$(\\mu - \\sigma)  &lt; x &lt; (\\mu + \\sigma)$$\nSimilarly, there is a 95.45% chance that the draw will be within two standard\ndeviations of the mean:\n$$(\\mu - 2\\sigma)  &lt; x &lt; (\\mu + 2\\sigma)$$\nAnd there is a 99.73% chance that the draw will be within three standard\ndeviations of the mean:\n$$(\\mu - 3\\sigma)  &lt; x &lt; (\\mu + 3\\sigma)$$\nImpact of Standard Deviation\nAs stated the mean and the standard deviation characterize a normal distribution. The common statistical notation for this is:\n$$x \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma)$$\nConsider a stock with returns having a mean of 8%. What happens to the\ndistribution as the standard deviation increases? It gets shorter in the middle\nand the overall distribution gets wider.\nThis analysis uses Matt Bognar's web\napplet to show\nthe effect of increasing the standard devation. In both cases the mean is the\nsame 8%. In the first case, the normal is N(8, 2), so a standard deviation of\n2%. In the second case the normal is N(8, 3) - so the same mean and a wider\nstandard deviation of 3%. \nN(8,2) with probability greater than 6\n\n\n\nN(8,3) with probability greater than 5\n\n\n\nHere are some observations:\n\n\nIn both cases the middle of the bell curve is the mean, 8%. This will always\nbe the case with a normal distribution. Statistically, if you play the game\nenough you should expect to receive an average return of the mean, in this\ncase 8 percent.\n\n\nThe larger the standard deviation the flatter and wider the distribution gets.\nMore area is allocated to the tails (i.e. the right and left ends of the\ngraph). \n\n\nThe tool has the nice feature of letting you enter an x value and it shows\nyou the probability of getting above x. In both cases I chose a value that is\none standard devaition below the mean. This is why they have the same\nprobabilities of a random draw being above x.\n\n\nIn terms of interpreting the standard deviation - simply put that represents the\nrisk of the investment. Larger standard deviation means more risk. That can be\nseen because the former has an upside best case of around 15% returns (right\nside of graph) and a lower case of somewhere around 0% (left side of graph),\nwhereas the latter with a 3% standard deviation has a upside of 20% and a\ndownside of -5% or so per the eye's preference. Technically, there are no limits\nto how bad or how good things can get on a single draw - but the probabilites\nget super low (i.e. approach 0) out at the tails. In both cases, if you play the\ngame enough times your average of returns will be 8%.\nIt is important to remember both edges or tails of the curve move away from the\nmean when the standard devation increases. This means there is more of a chance\nof much larger returns and more of a chance of much smaller returns. Both are\npresent but being risk averse creatures means we tend to worry about the left\nside of the distribution more (i.e. how much might I lose).\nIn the two plots above the means were the same at 8% and the standard deviations\ndiffered. One was 50% riskier than the other (i.e. 3% is a 50% higher standard\ndeviation that 2%). The relationship of the mean and the standard deviation are\nin a sense shared by all normal curves. This is why the probability of having a\nreturn larger than one standard deviation below the mean is the same in both\ncases. So what is the big deal with this increase in standard\ndeviation/riskiness? Well, we care about that risk and a better question to ask\nis - what is the probability of getting a return larger than some arbitrary\nnumber, say 6%. This is exactly what the first plot shows when the normal has a\n2% standard deviation. To see what that would be for a normal with a 3% standard\ndeviation the following plot illustrates:\nN(8,3) with probability greater than 6\n\n\n\nIn this case there is only a 74.75% chance of getting a higher return than 6%\nwhereas in the original 2% standard deviation case there was an 84.13% chance.\nThe average return has not changed, the riskiness has increased and in\nconsequence we have a smaller chance of hitting some lower bound target.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/education/return-variance/","title":"Return Variance"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/education/time-value-of-money/":{"body":"\nConsistere silvaque facta\nTimemus genitor et inportuna annua Amphrysi non\nLorem markdownum Bromumque aethera canam terga crimen tamen\ntemplo tellure et docuique Lucifero virgo magnae\nindagine murmure!

It is the root of\nall financial information covering a user's specific situation. It is comprised\nof a set of Worths which are non-financial assets that have value and are\nworth tracking (think house, boat, land, valuable art), a Balance Sheet that\ncovers financial accounts and all the holdings therein, and FlowSpecs or cash\nflow specifications which are used to define series of cash flows. The details\nof these modeled items are described below with examples provided.\nWorths\nThese are any items of significant value. Use your own judgement when entering\nthese. In general, if you feel they could make a difference in your life\nfinancially, put them in. The larger your net-worth the less important some\nnon-financial assets are.

There are two types of FlowSpecs:\n\n\nValueFlowSpec: This is just a dated list of date/money value pairs. For\nexample, you might have an expected outflow of dollar amounts in the future.\nSuppose you agree to sell a house to a relative in 10 years for $200K and to\nease the pain you allow the payment to be in four annual installments of $50k. As a ValueFlowSpec it would be:\nValueFlowSpec {\n              year_values: vec![\n                  YearValue {\n                      year: 2032,\n                      value: 50000.0,\n                  },\n                  YearValue {\n                      year: 2033,\n                      value: 50000.0,\n                  },\n                  YearValue {\n                      year: 2034,\n                      value: 50000.0,\n                  },\n                  YearValue {\n                      year: 2035,\n                      value: 50000.0,\n                  },\n              ],\n          }\n\nThis is a rather specific and maybe unlikely example. However, the ability to\ncreate such arbitrary streams of cash flows programmatically is useful. Note\nall dollars in the ValueFlowSpec are in terms of the year of the entry, not\nin current dollars.\n\n\nGrowingFlowSpec: This can be used to model a set of future cash flows, the\namount of which follows a similar stochastic process as a stock might. For\nexample, college costs tend to increase over time much like stocks rise in\nvalue over time. The same method of specifying growth of a stock can be used\nto model the growth of a set of cash flows. These specifications have an\ninitial value (actually a dated value), a year range over which the flows\noccur, and some specification of the growth characteristics. The goal of the\nsystem is to make modeling easy but provide backdoors for flexibility. Here is\na sample specification for a set of college costs that today would amount to\n$35K per year where the growth applied in the intervening years and throughout\nthe four years of education is pulled from the database:\n  flowSpec {\n      id = \"College Costs\"\n      growingSpec = growingFlowSpec {\n\n          initialValue = yearValue {\n              year = 2022\n              value = 35000.0\n          }\n          yearRange = yearRange {\n              start = 2032\n              end = 2036\n          }\n          growth = itemGrowth {\n              val gi = growthItemsByName.getValue(\"college_expense\")\n              this.growthItemId = gi.id\n          }\n      }\n  }\n\n\n\nAn Example Dossier\nFollowing is an example dossier with some modeled Worths, Holdings and\nFlowSpecs. The first column are the indices, the second are the identifying\ninformation, and the third some indication of value.\nWhen creating a Worth the user provides the value of the worth as of some time\nhopefully recently. The user can specify a GrowthAssumption or select an\nassociation to a predefined system managed growth (See also Growth\nAssumptions). The preference should be\nto always use system managed growth categories if applicable. This way those\ntypes of assumptions can be swapped out with assumption presets.\nWhen adding Holdings the user provides the cost basis (i.e. how much it cost\nto enter the position) and a valuation. The user can specify a\nGrowthAssumption or select an association to a predefined system managed\ngrowth (See also Growth\nAssumptions).\nIndexId/NameValue\nWorths\nW(0)House(2022:＄780,000)\nW(1)Grandpa's Estate(2022:＄215,000)\nAccounts\nAcc1 - Primary (TAXABLE)\nA(0)H(0)SPY(1000.000@(2022:＄376)) Cost(＄332,415)\nA(0)H(1)VB(100.000@(2022:＄190)) Cost(＄17,523)\nA(0)H(2)CSCO(3200.000@(2022:＄45)) Cost(＄150,400)\nA(0)H(3)AAPL(300.000@(2022:＄147)) Cost(＄42,000)\nA(0)H(4)Bond(1.000@(2022:＄99,857)) Cost(＄98,231)\nAcc2 - BrightStart (COLLEGE_IRS_529)\nA(1)H(0)Blend(2030)/Billy's 529(1.000@(2022:＄13,750)) Cost(＄14,000)\nA(1)H(1)Blend(2033)/Sara's 529(1.000@(2022:＄6,732)) Cost(＄6,000)\nAcc3 - 401K (TRADITIONAL_IRS_401_K)\nA(2)H(0)VTI(165.525@(2022:＄376)) Cost(＄45,300)\nFlowSpecs\nF(0)Living Expenses Pre-RetirementInitial(2022:＄80,000) Range(2022-&gt;2036)\nF(1)Living Expenses RetirementInitial(2022:＄50,000) Range(2036-&gt;2066)\nF(2)College CostsInitial(2022:＄35,000) Range(2032-&gt;2036)\nF(3)Custom FlowSpec ExampleValues((2028:＄1,500), (2029:＄1,700), (2030:＄1,200))\n\nIn this example dossier there are two worths, eight holdings across three\naccounts and four flow_specs.\nThis view of the dossier shows the items that go into the forecasting engine.\nBut it does not show the growths associated with those items.

If a flow_spec makes it through with no\ncategory then the direction can arbitrarily expense which are probably more\ncommonly modeled in a categorical way.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/tool_docs/flow-direction/","title":"Flow Direction"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/tool_docs/forecast-steps/":{"body":"\nThe process of creating a forecast involves the steps outlined below. The\nReturnForecast performs the steps using several other objects:\n\n\nGet Next Set Of Sample Returns\nThe goal is to support multiple ways of calculating returns. The primary and\ninitial approach is geared toward the typical Monte Carlo simulation in which\nreturns are modeled as normally distributed variables with (optionally)\nassigned correlations. Another approach for the Monte Carlo simulation is to\nuse historic returns instead of randomly generated correlated returns.\nIn either case, this step gets a set of generated returns for each of the\ngrowing items (worths, holdings, flow_specs). The Monte Carlo struct\nuses the Simulation trait to shield details of obtaining sample\nreturns. \npub trait Simulation {\n    /// Gets sample return for item (`worth`, `holding`, `flow`) identified by `sample_return_index`.\n    ///\n    ///   * **sample_return_index** - Index of the growth item.\n    ///   * _return_ - Sample return for the item\n    fn get_sample_return(&amp;self, sample_return_index: u32) -&gt; f64;\n\n    /// Generates next sample of correlated data\n    fn next_sample(&amp;mut self);\n}\n\nThere are currently two structs implementing this trait:\n\n\nCorrelatedSimulation: The functions in this struct generate random returns\nbased on the items' resolved growth assumptions and then uses the Cholesky\nmatrix turn those uncorrelated returns into correlated returns, storing them all\nin a private variable sample_returns. \n\n\nHistoricSimulation: (WIP) The function this trait (will) stream the historic\nreturns through the simulator.\n\n\nApply Sample Returns\nThe MonteCarloSimulator then gets those sample returns (via\nget_sample_return) and updates the growth items' PeriodBalance data\nappropriately. The purpose of this step is to incorporate the growth (or loss\ndepending on the return) for each item that has been resolved. \nWorth Return Application\nEach of the growth item types are wrapped in a utility struct that tracks the\nPeriodBalance for the year's forecast. \nFor example, this loop gets the simulated return for each worth and updates the\nPeriodBalance.\nfor worth_wrapper in &amp;mut self.dossier_wrappers.worth_wrappers {\n    let sample_return = self\n        .simulation\n        .get_sample_return(worth_wrapper.sample_return_index);\n\n    worth_wrapper\n        .period_data\n        .grow_balance_by_annual_rate(sample_return);\n}\n\nIt is this step that causes the value of a House, for example, to grow at some\nmodeled rate, e.g. N(7%, 2%), annually.\nFlowSpec Return Application\nThere are two types of FlowSpecs: GrowingFlowSpec and ValueFlowSpec. The\nGrowingFlowSpec is treated much like the worths, while the ValueFlowSpecs\nare ignored since any desired growth is baked into the values. \nfor flow_spec_wrapper in &amp;mut self.dossier_wrappers.flow_spec_wrappers {\n    use crate::OneOfFlowSpec;\n\n    // Ignore `ValueFlowSpec` since they don't grow\n    if let Some(OneOfFlowSpec::GrowingSpec(_)) =\n        flow_spec_wrapper.flow_spec.one_of_flow_spec\n    {\n        let sample_return = self\n            .simulation\n            .get_sample_return(flow_spec_wrapper.sample_return_index);\n\n        #[cfg(debug_assertions)]\n        let original_period_data = flow_spec_wrapper.period_data;\n\n        flow_spec_wrapper\n            .period_data\n            .grow_balance_by_annual_rate(sample_return);\n\n        #[cfg(debug_assertions)]\n        tracing::info!(\n            \"{} from {:?} to {:?}\",\n            flow_spec_wrapper.flow_spec.name,\n            original_period_data,\n            flow_spec_wrapper.period_data\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nFor GrowingFlowSpecs the annual flow is grown based on the modeled rate. This\nis what allows your living expense (e.g. $70K) to grow at some modeled rate,\ne.g. N(3%, 1.3%) annually.\n\nNote It may seem strange that a FlowSpec is wrapped in a\nFlowSpecWrapper containing PeriodData which contains attributes like\nperiod_balance and sample_return. The values stored in the\nperiod_balance are not really balances like that associated with a house. It\nis actually the value of the flow that is growing over time, like the value a\nhouse might. Flows are not part of the BalanceSheet but reusing the\nPeriodData makes sense since the value of the flows grow in the same way as\nthe value of worths or holdings and the cumulative growth in that initial\nvalue is similar to the cumulative growth of worths and holdings.\n\npub struct PeriodBalance {\n    ///\n    /// Balance at start of period.\n    #[prost(double, tag=\"1\")]\n    pub start_balance: f64,\n    ///\n    /// Balance at end of period.\n    #[prost(double, tag=\"2\")]\n    pub end_balance: f64,\n}\npub struct PeriodData {\n    /// Simulated return for the current period.\n    pub sample_return: f64,\n    /// Cumulative return for the forecast.\n    pub cum_return: f64,\n    /// Period balance.\n    pub period_balance: PeriodBalance,\n    /// Balance in usd\n    pub balance_usd: f64,\n}\npub struct FlowSpecWrapper&lt;'a&gt; {\n    /// The wrapped flow_spec.\n    pub flow_spec: &amp;'a FlowSpec,\n    /// Link to growth assumption\n    pub simulation_entry: &amp;'a SimulationEntry,\n    /// Index into simple returns for flow_spec\n    pub sample_return_index: u32,\n    /// Period data, updated each year of forecast.\n    pub period_data: PeriodData,\n}\n\nHolding Return Application\nHoldings growth is similar to worth growth. The main difference is that the\nHoldingWrapper uses a the TaxablePosition utility struct to aid in dealing\nwith lotting/accounting over time. Rather than just updating the PeriodData\nwith a new balance we set a new mark_price for the taxable position and let it\nmanage the market value stored in the PeriodData::PeriodBalance.\nfor account_wrapper in &amp;mut self.dossier_wrappers.account_wrappers {\n    for holding_wrapper in account_wrapper.holding_wrappers.iter_mut() {\n        let sample_return = self\n            .simulation\n            .get_sample_return(holding_wrapper.sample_return_index);\n\n        let updated_price = holding_wrapper.taxable_position.mark_price\n            * annual_gross_return(sample_return);\n\n        tracing::debug!(\n            \"Marking holding {} from {} to {} for sample return {}\",\n            holding_wrapper.holding.instrument_name,\n            holding_wrapper.taxable_position.mark_price,\n            updated_price,\n            sample_return\n        );\n\n        holding_wrapper\n            .taxable_position\n            .set_mark_price(updated_price);\n\n        holding_wrapper\n            .period_data\n            .period_balance\n            .set_end_balance(holding_wrapper.taxable_position.current_value());\n    }\n}\n\nCalculate Distributions\nNow that the sample returns have been applied, the holdings have distributions\nthat must be accounted for:\n\nEquities: May pay dividends, that are classified as qualified or unqualified.\nBonds: Pay interest\nMutual Funds: May pay distributions as dividends, interest and capital gain\ndistributions.\n\nThis step takes those distributions from the holdings, reduces the value of\nTaxablePosition accordingly, and stores the values in the Netting struct for\nlater. The ReturnForecast passes the distributions to the ForecastState\nwhich is responsible for currency conversion before being netted in.\nA simple example:\n\nYou own 100 shares of IBM. It grows 8% due to capital gains (via the sample\nreturn). It is modeled to distribute 4% as qualified dividends. The previous\nstep grew the price by 8%. During this period the dividend will be 4% of the\nnotional value. Which market value should be used as the basis for the 4%\ndividend? We could use the value before the 8% increase, the value after the\n8% increase, or something in between. We choose to average the market value\nand select a distribution of 4% of that. We take the percentage those\ndistributions are of the current market value and reduce the current positions\nmark_price by that percentage, since dividends are not free money. The value\nof the dividends is posted to the netting.\n\nNetting Flows\nThis step iterates over all modeled flow_specs and incorporates any flows\noccurring in the forecast year into the netting. Each flow is classified as an\nin flow or an out flow since all values are positive. The ReturnForecast\npasses the directional flows to the ForecastState which is responsible for\ncurrency conversion before being netted in.\nSome of these flows, depending on category (e.g. Labor Income, Medical Expense,\nIra Contributions) need to be netted into TaxInputs::Incomes or\nTaxInputs::maybe_deductible_expenses. TaxInputs::Incomes is simply a breakdown\nclassifying the type of income for tax purposes and it is motivated primarily by\nUS tax calculations. But it is a safe bet these breakdowns may be useful for other tax regimes.\nOn the expense side, however, it is not clear how best to handle them. According to recent\nForbe's article there are several expense types that may provide deductions:\n\nMedical Expenses,\nIRA Contributions\nMortgage Interest\nState Taxes\n...\n\nIt is not clear how many of those will map to other countries. Many other\ncountries have a more comprehensive health coverage system and less complex\ntaxation so probably less of a need for deducting medical expenses? Anyway,\nTaxInputs is being created to send to any TaxCalculators.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/tool_docs/forecast-steps/","title":"Forecast Steps"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/tool_docs/gbr-taxes/":{"body":"\nConsistere silvaque facta\nTimemus genitor et inportuna annua Amphrysi non\nLorem markdownum Bromumque aethera canam terga crimen tamen\ntemplo tellure et docuique Lucifero virgo magnae\nindagine murmure!

This section\nfocuses on how growth assumptions are modeled and associated with items in the\ndossier. The goal of this system is to make all such growth assumptions:\n\n\neasily defaulted The ideal streamline case is you don't need to enter\ngrowth assumptions so much as describe the item by associating it with a\npredefined growth category (e.g. UsEquityMarket) and have the system provide\nit.\n\n\nextremely flexible Should you want to control any growth assumption you\nhave the ability.\n\n\nIn the previous section we saw a sample dossier which will be used in this\nsection to describe the process of controlling the growth assumptions.\nTailoring Market Growth Assumptions\nThe majority of growth assumptions for items in a dossier can be given\nreasonable default values by associating them with descriptive categories stored\nin the system. For each of worths, holdings and flow_specs (the\nGrowingFlowSpec variety) the user may select from an appropriate list of\nsystem managed growth values. The system growth assumptions are stored under the\nsystem user named plusauri. Each user can create their own growth assumption\nsets, independent of any dossier.

Now that the items in the dossier\nhave been assigned growths - how are they related?

This section explores how the various growth\nassumptions in a dossier are related to each other. \nAny two items that grow by some normal distribution (N(μ,σ)) might have have\nsome impact on the others or at least a tendency to move either in similar or\nopposite directions. This relationship is called correlation and whenever there\nare suitable numbers for correlations they should be used. When two\ndistributions tend to move in the same direction they are said to be positively\ncorrelated and when they tend to move in the opposite direction negatively\ncorrelated. Correlation numbers are normalized over the range [-1.0 to 1.0]\nwhere -1.0 is perfect negative correlation (e.g. if one goes up 10% the other\ngoes down 10%) and 1.0 is perfect positive correlation (e.g. if one goes up\n10% the other does as well). \n\nImportant All forecasts will run fine without any correlations\nspecified. For any pair of items in the system a missing correlation entry is\nsimply assigned a 0 correlation indicating the values are not correlated. Of\ncourse, good correlations should improve forecasts over no correlations - but\nit is not worth getting worked up over some missing correlations on very\nindividual items where no history is available.\n\nUser Item Correlations\nSimilar to growth assumptions the system provides defaults for growth\ncorrelations for the growth item categories where reasonable.

Once again, the following is test data showing\nsaved correlations of plusauri, the system user, and the user test1.\n\nNote These correlations are from the test system and are randomly generated.\nTherefore they should not be used - unless we happen to be very lucky in\nrandomly generating correlations.\n\nSample/Generated  Correlations By User\nUserOutlookRowColumnCorrelation\nU(plusauri)O(Standard)G(ResidentialRealEstate:1)G(UsLargeEquity:8)0.5072\nU(plusauri)O(Standard)G(ResidentialRealEstate:1)G(UsSmallEquity:12)0.2976\nU(plusauri)O(Standard)G(UsEquityIndividual:6)G(UsEquityMarket:7)0.6324\nU(plusauri)O(Standard)G(UsEquityMarket:7)G(CollegeExpense:41)0.0992\nU(plusauri)O(Standard)G(UsEquityMarket:7)G(Commodities:28)0.1737\nU(plusauri)O(Standard)G(UsEquityMarket:7)G(LivingExpense:39)0.0792\nU(plusauri)O(Standard)G(UsEquityMarket:7)G(LongTermUsCorpBond:22)0.2098\nU(plusauri)O(Standard)G(UsEquityMarket:7)G(UsLargeEquity:8)0.9389\nU(plusauri)O(Standard)G(UsEquityMarket:7)G(UsSmallEquity:12)0.6955\nU(plusauri)O(Standard)G(UsLargeEquity:8)G(LongTermUsGovBond:21)0.1847\nU(plusauri)O(Standard)G(UsLargeEquity:8)G(UsMidEquity:10)0.6412\nU(plusauri)O(Standard)G(UsLargeEquity:8)G(UsSmallEquity:12)0.6373\nU(plusauri)O(Standard)G(UsSmallEquity:12)G(CollegeExpense:41)0.1423\nU(plusauri)O(Standard)G(UsSmallEquity:12)G(LivingExpense:39)0.1499\nU(plusauri)O(Standard)I(AAPL:3)G(UsEquityMarket:7)0.3238\nU(test1)O(Standard)G(ResidentialRealEstate:1)G(UsLargeEquity:8)0.1750\nU(test1)O(Standard)G(UsEquityIndividual:6)G(UsEquityMarket:7)0.7694\nU(test1)O(Standard)G(UsEquityMarket:7)G(Commodities:28)0.0251\nU(test1)O(Standard)G(UsLargeEquity:8)G(LongTermUsCorpBond:22)0.2791\nU(test1)O(Standard)G(UsLargeEquity:8)G(UsMidEquity:10)0.7408\nU(test1)O(Standard)I(AAPL:3)G(UsEquityMarket:7)0.2594\n\nIn this case the test1 user is setting things up to run forecasts where his\nsystem correlations take precedence over the system's correlation numbers.

For any pair of indices that test1 user\nhas no correlation entered, the system number will be used.\n\n| Row Index                | Column Index               | Correlation |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------|\n| G(UsEquityMarket:7)      | I(AAPL:3)                  | 0.3238      |\n| G(UsEquityMarket:7)      | G(UsEquityIndividual:6)    | 0.6324      |\n| G(UsSmallEquity:12)      | G(ResidentialRealEstate:1) | 0.2976      |\n| G(UsSmallEquity:12)      | G(UsEquityMarket:7)        | 0.6955      |\n| G(LongTermUsCorpBond:22) | G(UsEquityMarket:7)        | 0.2098      |\n| G(LivingExpense:39)      | G(UsEquityMarket:7)        | 0.0792      |\n| G(LivingExpense:39)      | G(UsSmallEquity:12)        | 0.1499      |\n| G(CollegeExpense:41)     | G(UsEquityMarket:7)        | 0.0992      |\n| G(CollegeExpense:41)     | G(UsSmallEquity:12)        | 0.1423      |\n\n\nSparse View of Correlation Matrix\n\nI(AAPL:3)G(ResidentialRealEstate:1)G(UsEquityIndividual:6)G(UsEquityMarket:7)G(UsSmallEquity:12)G(LongTermUsCorpBond:22)G(LivingExpense:39)G(CollegeExpense:41)\nI(AAPL:3)1.0_______\nG(ResidentialRealEstate:1)01.0______\nG(UsEquityIndividual:6)001.0_____\nG(UsEquityMarket:7)0.323800.63241.0____\nG(UsSmallEquity:12)00.297600.69551.0___\nG(LongTermUsCorpBond:22)0000.209801.0__\nG(LivingExpense:39)0000.07920.149901.0_\nG(CollegeExpense:41)0000.09920.1423001.0\n\n\nScrollable View of Dense Correlation Matrix\nImportance Of Good Correlations\nNotice there are several 0's in the lower triangular matrix. As previously stated,\nthis is not a problem. In terms of correlations more data is better, provided\nthey are good correlation numbers. But it is well established that, like average\nreturns, correlations are not standing still. Market correlations used are\nthemselves averages of correlations over time. When markets get scared many\ncorrelations increase.\nMonte Carlo simulation is all about generating lots of samples from modeled\ndistributions - and then letting the chips fall where they may. If only the\ndistributions for each growing asset were available (e.g. the assigned\n(N(μ,σ)) for each item) monte carlo still does it's magic. But it without\ncorrelations it cannot capture the interplay of return movement. \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/tool_docs/growth-correlations/","title":"Growth Correlations"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/tool_docs/incorporating-taxes/":{"body":"\nIdeally we want the system to be usable by residents in countries beyond the USA.\nThe approach to supporting that is to hide those details behind a trait class.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/tool_docs/incorporating-taxes/","title":"Incorporating Taxes"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/tool_docs/managing-correlations/":{"body":"\nConsistere silvaque facta\nTimemus genitor et inportuna annua Amphrysi non\nLorem markdownum Bromumque aethera canam terga crimen tamen\ntemplo tellure et docuique Lucifero virgo magnae\nindagine murmure!

In this approach the focus is on the\nbond return and treating any gains as bond interest. Each Holding has an\noption to specify a DistributionPolicy that can resolve to a\nDistributionSpec which enumerates the distributions of the instrument in\npercentage terms for the types of distributions:\n\nQualified Dividends\nUnqualified Dividends\nCapital Gain Distributions\nInterest\n\nBonds can be modeled by specifying the bond distribution (i.e. interest) as a\npercentage of holding value that is distributed.\nExample Bond Distribution Spec\nDistribution TypePercent\nqualified dividends0%\nunqualified dividends0%\ncapital gain distributions0%\ninterest2.5%\n\nThis distribution spec is stating that the holding will distribute 2.5% of\nits value each year. This is not a statement of growth in value of the bond. As\nwith all holdings the growth rate is dictated by the resolved growth assumption.\nFor example, this bond might have a resolved growth assumption of N(3%, 1%)\nwhich would be used to simulate the growth of the bond. Each year the\ndistribution of 2.5% of the holding value would be paid out as interest by\nthe bond. \nThis view of bonds makes it easy to model overall bond-like instruments or\nportfolios without getting bogged down into details of coupons. With this\napproach the interest payments will vary year by year based on the value of the\nholdings. That is not quite how bonds work. But what makes it bond-like is:\n\nThe interest payments each year are treated as interest for tax purposes\nThe value of the bond may fluctuate based on a distribution supported by\nhistoric returns (e.g. N(3%, 1%) in this case).\n\nWith An Associated Rate Curve\nAssume the following cash payments are associated with a bond with face value of $150K.\nSample Bond (U S TREASURY NOTE CPN 1.75000 % MTD 2026-12-31 DTD 2019-12-31)\nSettlement dateTrade dateTransaction typeQuantityPriceAmount\n06/30/202206/30/2022Interest----$1,312.50\n12/31/202112/31/2021Interest----$1,312.50\n06/30/202106/30/2021Interest----$1,312.50\n12/31/202012/31/2020Interest----$1,312.50\n06/30/202006/30/2020Interest----$1,312.50\n01/02/202012/31/2019Buy150,000.00$99.52– $149,287.86\n\nA convenient way to enter this bond would be to enter this spec.\nBond Spec\nHere are the attributes of a bond with fixed coupon of $1,312. For this bond,\nthis set of information is required for the system to model the payments of\nthe coupon payments of the bond for its duration.\n\nFace$150K\nCoupon (Annual)$1,312\nMaturityJun/2038\n\nAn alternative way of describing this is to quote the coupon as a percentage.\nHere is a web bond coupon calculator:\n\n\nSo an equivalent description of the bond attributes using a percentage is:\n\nFace$150K\nCoupon (Annual)1.75%\nMaturityJun/2038\n\nThe modeling structure for these attributes is, as follows.\npub struct BondSpec {\n    ///\n    /// The face value of the bond.\n    #[prost(double, tag=\"1\")]\n    pub face_value: f64,\n    ///\n    /// Annual bond payment. \n    /// Quoted as either dollar value or percent of `face_value` based on\n    /// `is_percent_of_face`.\n    #[prost(message, optional, tag=\"2\")]\n    pub annual_coupon: ::core::option::Option&lt;super::core::RateCurve&gt;,\n    ///\n    /// Maturity date.\n    #[prost(message, optional, tag=\"3\")]\n    pub maturity: ::core::option::Option&lt;super::core::Date&gt;,\n    ///\n    /// If true the values of `annual_coupon` represent percentage of face.\n    #[prost(bool, tag=\"4\")]\n    pub is_percent_of_face: bool,\n}\n\nWith this structure we can specify the coupon in dollars or percentage points,\nmaking sure to set the is_percent_of_face flag accordingly.\nWith this spec we know the payment structure of the bond. But we don't know its\nvalue, so it still needs to be marked. The best place to get a mark is to use\nthe portfolio page of where its held; they typically show the current value.\nSymbolNameQuantityPrice MarkCurrent balance\nMutual funds\nMGGPXMorgan Stanley Institutional Fund, Inc.
